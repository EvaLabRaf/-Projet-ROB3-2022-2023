### Beach Poly'bot

This code purpose is to drive the towing robot over the beach.

The robot is actually equipped with 2 control boards which drive the 2 motors of each side of the robot each, and a laser captor mounted on a 2 axis arm (You can see the details in the different Hugo session report).

The robot need a GPS beacon, which I have not put on the robot yet, so the actual code focuses in avoiding obstacles.
