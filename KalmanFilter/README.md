# Kalman Filter sub project

For the sensor fusion project we choose to implement the Kalman filter directly to the main project of our 5th and last year in the school.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
we are going to apply it on the GPS and or laser 
=======
we are going to use it 

The goal of the project is to reduce the noise on the GPS data to have a better precision of the position.

We will combine the GPS data with the robot movement data.

we need one model of the movement prediction and one measuring model to read the sensor information.

We need to define a state vector which have to be composed by the positions of the axis x and y ; and the speed of the axis x and y as well.

The matrix can be wrote like :
