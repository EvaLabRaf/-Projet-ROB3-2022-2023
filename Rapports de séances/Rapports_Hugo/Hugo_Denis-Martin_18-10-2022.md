## Goal of the session: finding all the last component we need to order them

After an interview with Mr. Masson, we change a lot of component and finally order them.

We order a different motor:

So I had to change the dimensions of the 3D models 
and adapt the connector.

I also found out how to make it, as the piece is going to support torsional stress, with a lot of torque for its size, resin printing would be the best way to make it. 

We decided not to put shock absorber on the wheels as each one got its own motor and can track.

The direction of the front wheels is going to be made by a servo-motor placed in the middle of the robot, and the drag is going to be moved at the end of the structure to take more advantage of the strength of the motors.
